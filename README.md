## OnChain Wallet

This is a multi-signature wallet that allows a user to set several other public keys (called custodians) to safeguard the transactions happening on that wallet.

Using smart contracts to enable checks, a user can rest assured that even if private keys are compromised, the adversary cannot transfer funds out of the wallet. Custodians must sign all transactions and a minimum threshold for the signing custodians must be met in order for a transaction to be processed.
